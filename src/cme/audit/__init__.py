"""Signed audit ledger for the Multi-Agent CFO OS.

Every board narrative / recommendation is written to an HMAC-SHA256-signed,
append-only JSONL ledger so the reasoning trail is tamper-evident. Scheme
extracted from the signed-ledger donors (cleanmandate, swarmfi-executor,
glacier-edge-arm, compliance-as-code-agent) and strengthened with per-record
signature chaining (each line signs the prior line's signature).
